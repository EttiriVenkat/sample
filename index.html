                        Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.

                        Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization.Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.

                        java script is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.

                        JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

                        JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort.

                        CSS design We will use CSS to give proper design effects to the HTML web structure that we have created in HTML code. The most difficult part is to display the picture in a different direction. Consider the picture is in the right direction and the text along with it is in the left direction.

                        CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation.

                        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is one of the most popular languages to design Web Pages and their content. HTML uses different tags, elements, images and some latest components to make Web Pages more attractive and user-friendly. With the help of some CSS, the look and feel of the web page can be easily changed.

                        It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages.
